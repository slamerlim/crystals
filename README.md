2D platformer action-slasher game made on Unity 2021.3.16f1 is ready to rock earlybirds!

For Windows and MacOS.

Gameplay is designed for slash-em-all as well as for speedrun.

What we got here:

Fight and health systems for Player and Enemies.

4 kinds of Enemies are ready to detect Player and kill him with up to 3 attack animations.

Floor spikes are sharp and bloodlust.

Player can run, jump, dash and attack with 4 different animations.

Checkpoints and respawn system.

Scoring system and pickups.

One-way and falling platforms.

2D lights system.

3 different particle systems.

Adaptive music and SFX made with FMOD: instruments are switching depending on current scene's conditions; most of enemies have their own riser-and-tension soundscapes which work with music. And of course we have different footsteps sound on different surfaces, as well as different attack and damage sounds.

Music, sound design, coding, level design, by SLAMER LIM.

Sprites, sound samples from royalty-free libraries.

No presets used, everything built from scratch.

Special attention payed to the fight system and sound design.
The first alpha release made by me as solo, but project is open for bootcamp.
Feel free to participate!
